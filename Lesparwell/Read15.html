        <p>the event, which was held on February 4 in the Audio Visual Hall.

            The hostel students gave spirited performances during the farewell, showcasing their skill in dance, singing, and other art forms. The audience was treated to a spellbinding exhibition of musical performances, vivacious dance routines, and hilarious sketches. The students gave their best during the performances, working hard to make the farewell a special occasion.
            
            The combined afterparty and dinner demonstrated the students’ bond from both hostels. The students socialized, danced, and shared stories, resulting in memories that will last a life time. Seniors were presented with mementos in the form of trophies and sashes from the juniors, which they will treasure as a reminder of their time at the hostel. The event was a befitting send-off for the outgoing students, who shared their experiences and memories from their time spent at the hostel.
            
            Overall, the 2023 Hostel Farewell was a memorable event that highlighted the hostel students’ talents and camaraderie.</p>
