        <p>spring. Located in the heart of New Delhi inside Rashtrapati Bhawan, the gardens are a burst of vivid blooms and a visual treat. The picturesque landscape full of manicured lawns and hedges, Mughal style canals, and terraces is breathtaking. 
            The gardens are known for more than hundred varieties of roses found here along with marigolds, petunias, lilies and bougainvilleas that dot the paths. By and large, it remained a rejuvenating and  informative experience where the students got a chance to appreciate and admire natureâ€™s wonders.</p>
